              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
              more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
              make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed
              up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
              thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
              completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a 
              VR startup. ”

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance
              from them and

              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
            a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
            and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
            no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
